                        Fearing the things that I might’ve missed out<br />
                        This is for people who are like me, a developer who barely
                        scratched the surface of the world of Software Development and
                        aims to gain mastery through efforts and repetition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="bigletter">H</span>ave you ever been to a situation
                        where you’re trying out new technology and by the time you are
                        comfortable using it, it changes to a new version? (Yes, Angular,
                        I’m looking at you!) Sucks right? The fear of missing out is kinda
                        real, for me, I guess?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By the time this blog has been published, there’s already a
                        plethora of technologies to choose from when creating products.
                        Software development world is constantly changing. As a developer,
                        you should be prepared to face these constant changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As part of my day-to-day developer tasks, I have countless tabs
                        and websites to consult whenever I encounter issues with my code.
                        Whether it’s a bad coding pattern or it’s just that I’m too noob
                        to do it, there’s always an open Chrome tab to help me find the
                        answers. The thing is, whenever I find a solution, I always go
                        down the rabbit hole and realize that I don’t have a deep
                        understanding of what I’ve been doing and fearing that I’m missing
                        on a lot of things. Rinse. Repeat.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <em>Am I competitive enough to keep up with the trend?</em>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Ask yourself this in the next 3-6 months without exploring new
                        things or improving your mastery over one thing. If the answer is
                        yes, then you’re doing well, if not, then there’s a need for some
                        adjustments. Here are some of what I think you and I should be
                        doing:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Determine the market trend</h3>

                    <p>
                        Is it a new JavaScript framework? A new library? A new tech stack?
                        Whatever it is, there will always be a piece of fundamental
                        information about it. That leads to the second step:
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Understand the basics</h3>

                    <p>
                        Frameworks and libraries are made from what I call a “Mother
                        language”, and if you don’t understand these languages of your
                        choice, you won’t be able to fully utilize these said technologies
                        to their fullest. What’s better, “Jack of all trades”, or “master
                        of one”? I think the latter sounds better to me.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Read and explore</h3>

                    <p>
                        After choosing the trend you decided to take, consume the
                        knowledge behind it and put it into practice. There’s no better
                        way to understand things than to practice using it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Fear is Good</h2>

                    <p>
                        Yep. You read it right. I think that fear is essential for us, not
                        only as a developer but as a human being. Fearing over something
                        that you might’ve missed out pushes you to evaluate yourself if
                        you’re going to the right path of the road you chose to take.
